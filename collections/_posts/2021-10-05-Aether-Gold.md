1. The pilgrims, bearing crosses, set their voyage upon the Seas of the Whole,
and they were bound for a New World. Their boat was sturdy, and of a different build.
Through Fire it moved, from Earth it was built.
2. From the four that have been, they beseech Life and Light anew, 
where Love dwells, and children rule. The fifth shall be the essence,
there lies the Grail, and there lies the answer.
3. They came unto a land of strangers, and as soon as they stepped out, then they saw the danger.
Of men, covering their faces. Ones of metal casks bearing red tails, and ones of blue steel helmets.
4. On top of the mount in which they gathered, there was a great wooden horse, like those
from the days of Troy.
5. On top of it playing and rocking in motion, one soldier with the sword unsheathed.
6. In great commotion the wooden horse fell in pieces, and from it a great arrow ascended to the heavens.
Hanging by a thread, the piercing arrow shattered the ceiling, and there fell the ethereal gold.
7. The gold formed into cloud, and the cloud into a crystal, of six sides unequal. 
8. As it fell onto the Earth, it bore a great deep tunnel, that lead to everywhere and nowhere,
to the beggining and the end, and where they both meet, a tunnel to the great unknown, a tunnel to the abyss.
